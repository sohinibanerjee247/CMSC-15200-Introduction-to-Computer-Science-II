# CMSC-15200-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-II
This sequence, which is recommended for all students planning to take more advanced courses in computer science, introduces computer science mostly through the study of programming in functional (Scheme) and imperative (C) programming languages. Topics include program design, control and data abstraction, recursion and induction, higher-order programming, types and polymorphism, time and space analysis, memory management, and data structures including lists, trees, and graphs. NOTE: Non-majors may use either course in this sequence to meet the general education requirement in the mathematical sciences; students who are majoring in Computer Science must use either CMSC 15100-15200 or 16100-16200 to meet requirements for the major.
